- compress config (selmaho cmavo-set + color)
    - make every value at level 0 a dict with two keys: color and cmavo-set.
    - then let the value of color be a string, and let the value of cmavo-set be a list.
- test driven development
- test: check selmaho disjointness
- file that shows off all color choices
- choose colors

## long term goals
- single character lexer
- semantically group selmaho instead of alphabetically
- grammar competition website
- color selection tool


## special selma'o (for special colors)
- cu
- i
- by
- koha / goha

you can some times remove spaces and the parser doesnt care. there are only finitely many cases to check.
